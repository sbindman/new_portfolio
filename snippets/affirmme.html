	<h1>Good Vibes Only </h1>
	
	<p> After talking with a friend who was in need of some positive affirmations at work, I decided to build Good Vibes Only.  This simple webpage was equally about the end product, and the process.  I wanted a tool that randomly generated affirmations but I also got the added benefit of having to come up with all of the sample text myself (and giving myself lots of encouraging compliments along the way).  The tool uses Markov Chains to dynamically generate positive encouragement.</p>
