	<h1>Seafood Fest App</h1>
	<p class="description">SeafoodFest is a Ballard tradition, and one of Seattle’s most iconic, eclectic Summer festivals! SeafoodFest celebrates Ballard’s historic connection to the fishing industry and the neighborhood’s Nordic roots. The festival app allows visitors to find points of interest at the festival and learn about the weekend schedule.  This project was built using NodeJS, Angular, and MapboxGL.  I completed this project through my work at SpatialDev.</p>
