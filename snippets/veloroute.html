	<h1>Veloroute</h1>
 <p class="description">Veloroute is a tool that allows city planners to evaluate potential bike route alternatives. Veloroute aggregates data regarding distance, elevation, speed limits and required traffic crossings, from OpenStreetMap and the City of San Francisco. Users are able to score routes by weighting variables according to their personal perception of importance. Additionally, users can visualize route-specific elevation data. 
        <br><br>
I developed Veloroute as my final project for Hackbright Academy.  I wanted to grow my software skills while working on a project I was passionate about. Through this project I learned about Javascript, Leaflet, APIs, designing and delivering web applications and general best practices for writing code.
