	<h1>Haras Project</h1>
	
<p>Haras is a responsive web application for mapping street harassment. It is a platform for people to share their stories and make their voices heard. Haras began as a collaboration with one of my fellow bootcamp grads.  We were both experiencing frequent street harassment and wanted a tangible way to document our experience.  Haras provided an opportunity to learn how to collaborate on a remote open-source project and collect meaningful and personally empowering data.</p>
