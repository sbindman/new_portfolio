	<h1>Shibori Tie Dye</h1>
<p>As a kid I did a lot of tie dye so I was really excited when I saw <a href='http://lovelyindeed.com/diy-indigo-shibori-dyed-kitchen-towels'/> this demo </a> for indigo tie dying because it is absolutely beautiful and much more sophisticated than anything I had previously dyed.  While I was excited with the results, this was a very messy activity.  If you are like me, and live in a tiny apartment, I would recommend making sure you have plenty of newspaper, and extra gloves lying around.</p>
