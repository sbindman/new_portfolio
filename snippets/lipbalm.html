	<h1>Lip Balm</h1>
	<p>My brother was nice enough to gift me ingredients for making lip balm. I found a million different recipes online and tried a bunch before finding a recipe I liked.  My favorite mixture ended up being equal parts shea butter, beeswax and coconut oil.  I also used a mixture of lavendar and sweet orange essential oils to add scent.</p>
