	<h1>Wanderlust</h1>
<p>Friends of mine often ask for advice of what to do and see while traveling.  I have been fortunate to visit a lot of great cities and wanted to organize my notes.  So far, Google Maps has been the best solution I have found to tracking and mapping locations. Wanderlust lets me put all of my maps in the same place in a way that can be shared with friends and family.</p>
