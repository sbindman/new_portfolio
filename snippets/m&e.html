	<h1>Monitoring & Evaluation Tool</h1>
	
	<p>The Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Tool enables users to examine how partner projects in select regions and countries are performing against dozens of USAID Feed the Future indicators. The M&E Tool was developed in partnership with The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), the USAID, and Spatial Development International (SpatialDev). The goal of this partnership is to support and expand USAID Missions' use of geospatial technologies and improve decision-making capacity in climate-smart agriculture and related areas through the use of geospatial tools.</p>
