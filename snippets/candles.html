	<h1>Candles</h1>
<p>I bought 10 pounds of soy wax on Amazon not fully understanding what I was getting myself into.  Luckily, that gave me lots of opportunities to experiment.  I am 15 candles in and still have lots of wax left.  Some of my favorite scents so far have been Grapefruit&Ginger, Lemon&Lemongrass and Grapefruit&Rosemary.  Similar to my experience with making lip balm, these candles required quite a bit of essential oil to have them be fragrant.  If you are interested in making candles, <a href='https://www.fix.com/blog/making-your-own-candles/'>here</a> is a great visual I used to get started.</p>
